DeepMutation is a mutation tool that learns how to generate mutants that are similar to *real bugs*.

At its core, DeepMutation relies on a Neural Machine Translation model that was trained to translate fixed code into buggy code. DeepMutation has learned from thousands of real world bug-fixes performed by developers, how to generate mutants that resemble real buggy code.


## Installation
TODO Jason?

## How to generate mutants
TODO Jason and Shiya?


## How it works
TODO Michele will describe the high-levle idea of the research paper.


## Credits
The infrastructure of DeepMutation was created by Jason Kimko ([@jskimko](https://github.com/jskimko)) and Shiya Wang ([@sywang15](https://github.com/sywang15)).
The underlying model was created and trained by Michele Tufano and Cody Watson, based on seq2seq.
